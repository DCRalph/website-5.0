description: A redesign of the BurgerFuel website
tech: Tailwind CSS\ Prisma\ Express.js

## What I Used

- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma
- Express.js
- ~~PlanetScale~~ (They removed there free tier)
- PostgreSQL

## How I did it

### Tailwind CSS

I used Tailwind CSS to implement the responsive design of the BurgerFuel website. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for flexible and customizable components. I leveraged Tailwind CSS's utility classes to efficiently style the website and ensure consistency across different devices and screen sizes.

### Prisma

I integrated a SQL database and used Prisma CRM to manage the website's data. Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that enables seamless storage of user profiles and other essential data. I used Prisma to create a database schema and generate a Prisma client. The Prisma client is a type-safe database client that enables smooth communication between the database and the server.

### Express.js

I employed Express.js as the server-side framework. Express.js is a fast and minimalist web application framework that provides robust features for web and mobile applications. I used Express.js to build a robust backend for smooth communication between the front-end and the database.

## Challenges

### Prisma

This was my first time using Prisma, so I had to learn how to use it. I had to learn how to create a database schema and generate a Prisma client. I also had to learn how to use the Prisma client to communicate with the database.
