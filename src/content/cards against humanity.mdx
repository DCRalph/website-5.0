## What it is

I made a web app for playing Cards Against Humanity online with friends. It's a simple web app that uses websockets to communicate between players. It's a fun game to play with friends and I wanted to make it easier to play online.

The web app was designed in a way where I can add more games in the future. I plan to add more games in the future.

## How it works

The backend is a Express JS server that uses websockets to communicate with the frontend. The frontend is plain HTML, CSS and JS.

The games are stored in a directory and the server loads them dynamically. The server also loads the game's assets dynamically.

Each game has a backend file and frontend files. The backend file is used to handle the game logic and the frontend files contain the HTML, CSS and client side JS for the game.

The server also has a lobby system where players can create and join lobbies. The lobbies are used to keep track of the players and the game state.

## How I did it

I used Express JS for the backend and plain HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend. I used websockets to communicate between the frontend and backend.

I used [socket.io](https://socket.io/) for the websockets. I created my own wrapper around socket.io to make it easier to use. It takes advantage of rooms for each lobby.

Its not the the most secure because it sends out the game state to all the players. This means that players can cheat by looking at the game state. I plan to fix this in the future. My thinking was it most likely won't be a problem because the players are plaing on mobile devices whitch make it harder to look at the game state.

## What I learned

I learned how to use websockets and how to use socket.io.
